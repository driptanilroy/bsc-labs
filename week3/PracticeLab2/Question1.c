1. Please find the output of a C program intended to print a pattern using integers. The pattern has N rows, where N is
input from the user. The first row begins with the number N and prints all numbers from N to 1 in decreasing order. The
second row starts with the number N-1, and so on. The last row has the single number 1. The following is the inverted
right triangle pattern for N=5:

Correct Output for N=5:
54321
4321
321
21
1


The program provided in the file has a semantic error, and it is printing the following pattern for N = 5:

Wrong Output for N=5:
1
21
321
4321
54321


Semantic error is different from syntactic error. It means the C code will successfully compile without error but will
not produce the intended results. Modify the provided code to rectify the logical error.

2. Modify the program slightly to print the following pattern as well:

54321
5432
543
54
5
